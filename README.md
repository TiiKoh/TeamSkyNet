# How to Use

Before running our program, Solr needs to be properly installed and configured, and all data you plan to use must be indexed. Solr must be running and the correct core must be selected. Once this is done, run attempt.py in the console. Please note that our project is configured for Finnish Wikipedia articles.

The program will prompt the user to give it a search term. It will return the number of documents found with the search term in the title and/or text, as well as the names and ids of the first 10 of these documents. It will also show a highlighted snippet for these documents.

The program will then prompt the user to enter another search term, or press 'enter' to quit.
